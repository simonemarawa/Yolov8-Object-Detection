# Yolov8-Object-Detection

The goal of this project is to perform object detection on garbage images using YOLO v8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model. The input data for this project is the "Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset" from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parohod/warp-waste-recycling-plant-dataset?select=.idea), which contains over 10,000 images of various types of garbage items, including plastic bottles, cardboard boxes, and aluminum cans. The dataset also includes annotations for each image, which identify the location and type of each garbage item.

Object detection on garbage images has important applications in the field of waste management, as it can help automate the process of sorting and recycling different types of garbage items. Traditional methods of garbage sorting are often slow, labor-intensive, and prone to errors, which can result in incorrect sorting and contamination of recyclable materials. By using object detection techniques like YOLO v8, we can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of garbage sorting, and reduce the environmental impact of waste.

In this project, YOLO v8 was perfomed on the resized images of size 640x640 pixels.

Overall, we will showcase the application of YOLO v8 in a real-world problem, and provide insights into how deep learning can be used to improve waste management and environmental sustainability.
